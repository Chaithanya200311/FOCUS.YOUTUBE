# FOCUS.YOUTUBE

The picture is: It's the night before the big exam, and we all know that familiar rush to cram everything from YouTube tutorials. As an Engineering student, I can proudly say we're experts in exploring the syllabus just a day before the test! But I still get distracted after opening YouTube searching for lectures and end up empty scrolling all day. And I tried so many extensions to channelize my focus but finally ended up building something exactly 24 hours before my final exam. I have been using it for the last 6 hours and have almost covered 2 modules.

Check it out and let me know if I have to add any more features to it: https://namitha-s-11465.github.io/FOCUS.YOUTUBE/

Sure, there might be similar tools out there, but building something tailored just for "me" is such a cool thing. Who knew Engineering skills could save us from the temptation of watching another BTS video?
