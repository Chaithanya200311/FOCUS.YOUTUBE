# FOCUS.YOUTUBE
Hey all,
We all understand the need and rush to watch and finish YouTube tutorials just hours before the exam. And if you are an Engineering student, we take the pride of exploring the syllabus just one day before exam. But still get distracted after opening YouTube searching for lectures and ending up empty scrolling all day. And I tried so many extensions to channelise my focus but finally ended up building something exactly 24hours before my final exam. I have been using it the last 6 hours and I have almost covered 2 modules.

Check it out and let me know if I have to add any more features to it : 

I am pretty sure something like this already exists, but the pleasure of making something for "you" to use it is really cool. Proud to be a passionate Engineer.
